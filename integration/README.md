# Integration System for Future Green

Welcome to the integration repository! This project is designed to help beginners and experienced developers manage the integration of the following components:

- A future React/TypeScript frontend
- Deployment of machine learning models prepared by data scientists
- Coordination with the Django backend in the futuregreen_MLE project

## Structure

- `frontend/` — Placeholder for the future React/TypeScript app
- `model_deployment/` — Scripts and configs for deploying ML models
- `backend/` — Integration scripts and configs for the Django backend (futuregreen_MLE)
- `scripts/` — Utility scripts for setup, deployment, and management

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository.
2. Read the `README.md` in each subfolder for specific instructions.
3. Use the provided scripts in `scripts/` to automate common tasks.

## Prerequisites
- Node.js & npm (for frontend)
- Python 3.x (for model deployment and backend integration)
- Docker (recommended for deployment)

## Next Steps
- Add your React/TypeScript frontend in `frontend/`
- Place model deployment scripts in `model_deployment/`
- Use `scripts/` for automation (see examples inside)

For more details, see the documentation in each folder.
